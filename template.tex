\abstract
The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) carries the imprints of the conditions in the early universe and the large-scale structure it has traversed as it travels to our telescopes. This radiation from the early universe serves as a window into the physics of our universe. From the CMB, we can study primordial gravitational waves, large scale structure formation, sum of neutrino masses, dark energy, dark matter, and fundamental physics. Achieving these ambitious science goals requires equally ambitious instrumentation.
CMB-S4 and ongoing stage 3 ground-based CMB experiments are designed to observe the CMB temperature and polarization signals to an unprecedented sensitivity. A combination of three Large Aperture Telescopes (LATs) and eighteen Small Aperture Telescopes (SATs) will measure the temperature and polarization anisotropy of the CMB with $\approx$500,000 background noise-limited detectors operating at $\approx$100\,mK, covering frequencies from $\approx$20 to $\approx$300\,GHz.

In order to measure the tiniest signals of the CMB, we must control optical systematics and advance detector sensitivity to unprecedented levels. I will discuss the techniques to control optical systematics, design highly sensitive detectors and feedhorn arrays, and characterize their performance. Using a holography imaging setup as a beam mapper, I will evaluate the performance of the optical properties of novel absorbers I developed, and beam map a complete cryogenic optical system. I developed software to model these systems,  including hardware imperfections, demonstrating how systematics propagate into measurements; the software also uses machine learning to correct such systematic errors by correcting alignment of mirrors.  Lastly, I will present a novel approach for characterizing the on-sky beam with maps from Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data Release 6.  Understanding the beam of the instrument is critical for characterizing the angular response of the instrument, and therefore critical for achieving the ambitious science goals in ACT and beyond.  I will present how stacking point sources from existing CMB maps to determine the instrument beam compares to the existing method of mapping planets.

% Working with junior members of the Simons Observatory was such a privilege, and I've made many deep friendships. The SAT holography measurements would not be possible without the team at University of California San Diego: \textbf{Remington Gerras}, \textbf{Joseph Seibert}, \textbf{Michael} \textbf{JB} \textbf{Max} \textbf{Tran} and \textbf{Dr. Kam Arnold}.  Thank you for working so hard during those two weeks and being so wonderful to work with.  

% Thank you to my fellow beam-fanatics, \textbf{Alexandre Adler} and \textbf{Nadia Dachlythra}, for giving me the most fun experience in Stockholm and for being so incredibly supportive through the years.  I consider you brilliant scientists and wonderful friends.   

% Many members I never worked with but developed friendships regardless: \textbf{Sanah}, \textbf{Lauren Sanders}, \textbf{Anna Kofman}, \textbf{Jenna}, \textbf{Julia Robe}.
