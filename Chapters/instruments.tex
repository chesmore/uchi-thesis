\section{The Simons Observatory}

The Simons Observatory (SO) is a series of millimeter-wave telescopes designed to observe the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarization signals to an unprecedented sensitivity~\cite{gali18, so19}. With the combination of one Large Aperture Telescope (LAT)~\cite{xu/etal:2020c, zhu18, orlo18, coppi/etal:2018} and three Small Aperture Telescopes (SAT)~\cite{ali20}, the experiment will measure the temperature and polarization anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background with $\sim$\,70,000 background noise limited detectors operating at $\sim$\,100\,mK. SO will test cosmic inflation during the early universe, characterize the primordial perturbations, measure the effective number of relativistic species and the sum of the neutrino masses, and improve our understanding of galaxy evolution and the era of cosmic reionization~\citep{so19}.
