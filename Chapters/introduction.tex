In 1965 at Bell Labs, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson serendipitously detected ``noise" with their microwave antenna.  This noise was isotropic (same in all directions) and homogenous (same in all locations), and was ultimately the measurement of the Cosmic Microwave Background; radiation from the early universe.
\begin{equation}
    I(\nu,T) = \frac{2h\nu^2}{c^2}\frac{1}{e^{\frac{h\nu}{k_B T}} -1}
    \label{eq:blackbody}
\end{equation}
The temperature spectrum of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) was measured to be a near-perfect black-body (Eq.~\ref{eq:blackbody}), with a mean temperature of~\cite{burke_graham-smith_wilkinson_2019}:
\begin{equation}
    T_{\text{CMB}} = 2.725\,K
\end{equation}
The spectrum lies in the infra-red range of the electromagnetic spectrum, and peaks at a wavelength $\lambda = 1.5\,\text{mm}$ (Figure~\ref{fig:cobe_power_spectra}). 

This near-perfect black-body is understood to originate during the early universe by the rapid collision of photons with free electrons (Thompson scattering), to keep radiation in thermal equilibrium with hot dense matter.  As the universe expanded and cooled, however, this spectrum kept its same form~\cite{weinberg_cosmo}.  Because it formed during the early universe, the CMB is a backlight into not only early universe properties, but also late universe physics such as large-scale structure and dark matter.  The CMB, therefore, carries a wealth of information about the fundamental physics of our universe.

\section{The Expanding Universe}
The evolution of the universe can be described using an extension of Einstein's equations.  To measure distances in an expanding universe, we employ the metric $ds$, which depends on the curvature of the space, with curvature $\kappa$:
\begin{equation}
    ds^2 = -c^2dt^2 + a(t)^2[dr^2 + S_\kappa (r^2)d\Omega^2]\text{ ,}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
    d\Omega^2\equiv d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta d\phi^2
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
    S_\kappa(r) = \begin{cases} R\sin(r/R) & (\kappa = +1) \\
  r & (\kappa = 0) \\
   R\sinh(r/R) & (\kappa = -1)\end{cases}
\end{equation}
Here, we consider the scale of the universe as a function of time $a(t)$, which relates to the redshift $z$ as
\begin{equation}
    a(t) = \frac{1}{a+z}\text{ ,}
\end{equation}
where we set today's $a=1$.  If $a(t)$ is increasing, then the object is ``red-shifted", or a decrease in frequency.  This relationship can be expanded for nearby sources:
\begin{equation}
    a(t)\approx a(t_0)[1+(t-t_0)H_0+ \ldots ]
\end{equation}
where we've introduced the Hubble Constant $H_0$.  The Hubble Constant quantifies the expansion of our universe:
\begin{equation}
    H_0\equiv \bigg(\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\bigg )_{t=t_0}\; .
\end{equation}
In recent decades, astronomers and cosmologists have worked to determine the exact value of $H_0$ using both early- and late-universe physics.  As the two methods return differing values of the Hubble Constant, this field continues to evolve with new statistical methods and precision instrumentation.

\section{The Three Equations of the Universe}
The dynamics of the universe are neatly described by three equations, which connect its curvature to the energy density $\rho$ and pressure $P$.

\noindent
\textbf{Friedmann Equation}:  Stemming from Einstein's relativistic field equations, the Friedmann equation describes a homogenous and isotropic universe:  
\begin{equation}
    \bigg ( \frac{\Dot{a}}{a} \bigg ) = \frac{8\pi G}{3c^2}\rho(t) - \frac{\kappa c^2}{R_0}\frac{1}{a(t)}
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is the energy density, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $c$ is the speed of light, $\kappa$ is the curvature parameter, and $R_0$ is the radius of curvature at present time $t=0$.  The energy density is evolving, and made up of matter ($\rho_m=\rho_{m0}a^{-3}$), radiation ($\rho_r=\rho_{r0}a^{-4}$), and a cosmological constant ($\rho_{\Lambda}=\rho_{\Lambda 0}$), thus the Friedman equation takes the form:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{H^2}{H_0^2} = \frac{\Omega_{r0}}{a^4} + \frac{\Omega_{m0}}{a^3} + \Omega_{\Lambda 0} + \frac{1-\Omega_0}{a^2}
\end{equation}
where we normalize the energy density $\rho$ by the critical density $\rho_c(t)$, where $\rho_c(t) = \frac{3c^2}{8\pi G}$~\cite{ryden_2016}.  This results in the new variable:
\begin{equation}
    \Omega(t) = \frac{\rho(t)}{\rho_c(t)}
\end{equation}
Today, cosmologists assume a standard model of cosmology, which is referred to as the ``$\Lambda$CDM model".  The $\Lambda$CDM model assumes a flat $\Omega(t)=1$ universe, consisted mostly of baryonic ($\Omega_b h^2$) and cold dark matter ($\Omega_c h^2$) densities.  We will discuss this model further in the next sections.

\noindent
\textbf{Fluid Equation}:  Energy conservation can also be applied to describe the dynamics of the universe through the first law of thermodynamics (Eq.~\ref{eq:thermo1}).  This implies the sum of gravitational potential and kinetic energy of expansion is conserved~\cite{ryden_2016}.
\begin{equation}
    dQ = dE + PdV
    \label{eq:thermo1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \dot{\rho} + \frac{3\dot{a}}{a}(\rho + P) = 0
    \label{eq:fluid_universe}
\end{equation}
\noindent
Solving the fluid equation (with $P=w\rho$) yields the equation of state:
\begin{equation}
    \rho \propto a^{-3(1+w)}
\end{equation}
with the time-independent $w$~\cite{weinberg_cosmo}.  For example, in the case of a cold matter dominated universe (e.g. dust, $P = 0$) $\rho\propto a^{-3}$, and in a hot matter universe (e.g. radiation, $P=\rho/3$) $\rho\propto a^{-4}$.

\noindent
\textbf{Acceleration Equation}: Combining the first two equations, which constrain an energy conserved universe, yields the acceleration equation describing how our universe expands over time.  
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\ddot{a}}{a} = - \frac{4\pi G}{3 c^2} (\rho + 3 P)
\end{equation}

\section{The Case for Cosmic Inflation}
Three pillars provide evidence for the Big Bang Theory, whereupon our universe came into existence.

\noindent
\textbf{The Expanding Universe}: As we've previously discussed in this chapter, the universe is predicted to be currently expanding.  This has been studied and proven by observations of late-universe objects like galaxies~\cite{1999ApJ...517..565P}.  By measuring the velocity and distance of an object, scientists determined (using the Hubble Law) objects in the past were closer together, and today are farther apart.  

\noindent
\textbf{The Cosmic Microwave Background}:
Radiation from a source of known temperature is described by a black-body spectrum.  We've introduced the CMB as radiation from the early universe.  We've also introduced the CMB as a blackbody spectrum.  It can be shown that, in an expanding universe, the blackbody will maintain its shape, its temperature will decrease as the wavelength shifts lower.  Therefore, the CMB serves as evidence of a dense hot radiation source before the universe expanded, with a consistent black-body shape.

\noindent
\textbf{Abundance of Light Elements}:  Such an abundance of light elements in today's universe suggests a hot, dense beginning to the universe.  As the universe cooled and expanded, light particles formed by a fusion process called Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN).  The amount of light particles measured today are in agreement with predictions made by BBN.

These three pillars indicate a valid understanding of cosmology, but this cosmology remains incomplete.  Problems which remain are listed below.  The theory of inflation has the potential to explain the mentioned puzzles.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Flatness problem:  Measurements of the observable universe present a nearly flat spatial geometry ($\Omega_{\text{total}}=1$).  This would imply a flat geometry at the initial moments of our universe as well.  But for what reason would the universe begin with a flat geometry?  Inflation answers this by suggesting our universe might have curvature, but this rapid expansion blows up any curvature such that the tiny amount we can observe appears flat. 
    \item Horizon problem:  The sky appears remarkably (and statistically) uniform in all directions.  The CMB confirms this, as we measure this radiation to be uniform to one part in $100,000$.  The particle horizon distance is only $2^{\circ}$, so how could the entire sky be so nearly uniform?  Inflation solves this because such an accelerated expansion creates a paradigm where all the observed sky has a chance to come into causal contact.
    \item Magnetic monopole problem:  Magnetic monopoles are analogous to electrons, which would emit a magnetic charge.  However, we have never measured a single monopole in our universe, nor do we know that they exist.  Meanwhile, the Grand Unified Theory (GUT) predicts an extremely low density of magnetic monopoles; GUT predicts one monopole per Hubble radius.  Inflation solves this by diluting the expected number of monopoles thus explaining why we have not measured a single one.
\end{enumerate}
\section{$\Lambda$CDM Cosmology}
Today, the universe is described by the $\Lambda$CDM model, which assumes a flat universe ($\Omega_{\text{tot}}=1$) which is expanding at an accelerating rate, and is dominated by cold dark energy and cold dark matter.  Further, the $\Lambda$CDM model assumes dark energy taking the form of a cosmological constant $\Lambda$, which is expressed as a constant energy density:
\begin{equation}
    \rho_\Lambda = \frac{c^2}{8\pi G}\Lambda 
\end{equation}
The $\Lambda$CDM model neatly models the universe in six parameters: the baryonic density $\Omega_b\,h^2$, the cold dark matter density $\Omega_c\,h^2$, $\ln(10^{10}A_s)$, the spectral index of inflation $n_s$, the size of the acoustic horizon at decoupling 100\,$\theta_{*}$, and the reionization optical depth $\tau$.  Further, the standard model assumes a constant number of neutrino $N_{\text{eff}}$ and sum of neutrino masses $\Sigma m_\nu$. The most up-to-date values are listed in Table~\ref{tab:cosmology_recent_results}.  All of these parameters impact the shape of the CMB spectra which we measure today.

\section{The CMB Temperature Power Spectra}
The Cosmic Microwave Background carries rich science in its temperature and polarization spectra.  The CMB temperature spectrum can be decomposed into spherical harmonics, which result in power spectra as a function of multipole moment $\ell$, where $\ell\approx180/\theta$ and $\theta$ is angular scale on the sky.  The temperature fluctuations of the CMB are decomposed into spherical harmonics:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\delta T}{T}(\theta,\phi) = \sum_{\ell=2}^{\infty} \sum_{m=-\ell}^{\ell} a_{\ell m} Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\phi)
    \label{eq:cmb_temp}
\end{equation}

where $\ell$ and $m$ are multipoles of the spherical harmonic $Y_{\ell m}$, $a_{\ell m}$ are expansion coefficients, and $\theta$ and $\phi$ represent the angular position on the sky.  You'll notice the first summation of Equation~\ref{eq:cmb_temp} begins at $\ell=2$ rather than $\ell=0$; the $\ell=1$ coefficient corresponds to the earth's motion with respect to the CMB, and the $\ell=0$ coefficient is the mean temperature of the CMB, so we neglect those terms.  The coefficients $a_{\ell m}$ are independent variables, and relate to the CMB's angular power spectra via:
\begin{equation}
    C_\ell^{TT} = \frac{1}{2\ell +1} \sum_{m=-\ell}^{m=\ell} |a_{\ell m}|^2
\end{equation}

This is the temperature power spectrum of the CMB.  Figure~\ref{fig:measured_cmb_spec} shows the measured CMB temperature power spectrum from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, the South Pole Telescope, and WMAP~\cite{Das_2014}.
\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = .8\textwidth]{Figures/temp_power_spectrum.pdf}
    \caption{The CMB temperature power spectra measured by WMAP (yellow), the South Pole Telescope (blue) and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (purple)~\cite{Das_2014}.  The temperature anisotropies of the CMB will be measured with the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4, two upcoming cosmology experiments, with further precision.}
    \label{fig:measured_cmb_spec}
\end{figure}

The shape of the CMB power spectra unlocks properties of the early universe.  For example, the first peak in the power spectrum at around $\ell\approx220$ corresponds to the angle at which we observe the sound horizon, or the distance that sound can travel between the big bang and recombination.  The measurement of this power spectrum's morphology can also determine physical matter and baryon densities.  The dark energy properties of our universe can be constrained by the power spectrum peak, as the dark energy and matter densities jointly alter the distance to last scattering~\cite{Hadzhiyska_2019}.  The matter denstiy of the universe alters the expansion of the universe, which determines when the universe reaches the temperature of last scattering, or when photons begin to stream freely.  The smaller angular scale distortions are in part due to an inhomogeneous universe at the time of last scattering ($z\approx 1100$).  

\section{The Polarized CMB}

The CMB is predicted to be polarized, due to Thompson scattering by free electrons during the era of recombination~\cite{weinberg_cosmo,Page_2007}.  Measuring this polarization would indicate the beginning of reionization and further have the potential to uncover primordial gravitational waves.  Just as the CMB's temperature spectrum is decomposed in spherical harmonics, we also decompose the polarized components.  We refer to the CMB's polarization signals as ``E-modes" and ``B-modes" after their likeness to curl-free (electric) and divergence-free (magnetic) fields (Figure~\ref{fig:e_b_pol}).
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = .45\textwidth]{Figures/EB_pol.pdf}
    \caption{The polarization modes of the CMB.  The E modes have no curl, while the B modes have no divergence.  The polarization pattern in the CMB is caused by...}
    \label{fig:e_b_pol}
\end{figure}

The E-modes are produced by the density perturbations via Thompson scattering from a local quadrupole.  For this reason, the EE spectra peaks when scattering is highest, and when velocity is highest, between the two temperature spectrum peaks.  Primordial gravitational waves produce B-modes through Thompson scattering.  Further, the large-scale structure gravitationally lenses CMB photons traveling through, adding to the B-mode polarization spectra.  The scalar-to-tensor ratio, $r$, is directly determined through measurements of the B-mode polarization, as scalar perturbations generate E-mode polarization.

Let's now define the polarization signal basis of E- and B-modes.  The electric field of a photon travelling in the $\hat{z}$-direction is described by
\begin{equation}
    \Vec{E} = (E_x\hat{x} + E_y\hat{y})e^{i k_z - \omega t } \text{ .}
    \label{eq:e_photon}
\end{equation}
The Stokes parameters make up the basis of a photon's polarization, which is obtained from the electric field $\Vec{E}$, with parameters: intensity $I$, linear polarization $Q$, diagonal polarization $U$, and circular polarization $V$ (Eq.~\ref{eq:e_photon} and Eq.~\ref{eq:stokes}).

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    I & = |E_x|^2 + |E_y|^2 \\
    Q & = |E_x|^2 - |E_y|^2 \\
    U & = E_x E_y^* + E_x^*E_y\\
    V & = i(E_x E_y^* - E_x^*E_y) \\
\end{split}
\label{eq:stokes}
\end{equation}

The CMB should not carry any circular polarization, but can occur due to secondary mechanisms which take place after the surface of last scattering.  Just as the temperature power spectrum is decomposed into spherical harmonics, we express the polarization of the CMB in terms of spin-2 (where $a^*_{-2,\ell m} = a_{2,\ell m}$) spherical harmonics:
\begin{equation}
(Q \pm iU) = \sum_{\ell m}^{\pm 2} a^{\pm 2}_{\ell ,m} Y_{\pm2,\ell m} \text{ ,}
\end{equation}
where the expansion coefficients $a_{\ell m }^E$ and $a_{\ell m }^B$ are defined as
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    a_{\ell m }^E & = -\frac{1}{2}(a_{\ell m}^2 + a_{\ell m}^{-2}) \\
    a_{\ell m }^B & = \frac{i}{2}(a_{\ell m}^2 - a_{\ell m}^{-2}) \text{ .}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The E- and B-modes of the CMB are then defined as
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    E(\theta,\phi) & = \sum_{\ell m} a_{\ell m }^E Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\phi) \\
    B(\theta,\phi) & = \sum_{\ell m} a_{\ell m }^B Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\phi) \text{ .}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
It follows that the CMB's polarized spectra are then defined as
\begin{equation}
    C_{\ell}^{XY} = \frac{1}{2\ell+1}\sum_m \langle a_{\ell m}^{X} a_{\ell m}^{Y*} \rangle 
\end{equation}
Here, $X$ and $Y$ can either be E-mode, B-mode, or temperature T spectra of the CMB, indicating cross-correlated spectra.

\section{Why Care About Beams?}
Every camera has a ``beam" (or optical response) which determines the optical performance (how your picture will turn out).  The smaller your beam, the higher the resolution of your picture.   The Field-of-View (FOV) determines how wide your picture can be.  The noise of your camera's detector determines how grainy the picture comes out.  All of these optical properties are defined by the camera's beam.  To take a picture of the CMB, the telescope is our camera; the beam of the instrument determines the optical performance at a given angular scale.  

This not only affects the immediate quality of our CMB maps, but also impacts the ability to study cosmological science.  Let's consider two cosmological parameters: the spectral index of inflation $n_{s}$, and the number of relativistic species $N_{\text{eff}}$.  The spectral index of inflation $n_{s}$ describes how fluctuations vary with angular scale.  Figure~\ref{fig:cmb_ns} shows the CMB power spectra at three different values of $n_{s}$ and at two different values of $N_{\text{eff}}$.
The red curve plots the achieved sensitivty of Planck for determining the spectral index $n_\text{s}$ and $N_{\text{eff}}$, showing $n_s\pm\sigma_{n_s}$, and $N_{\text{eff}}\pm\sigma_{N_{\text{eff}}}$.  The science goals of SO are plotted in blue to show the increase in sensitivity compared to Planck.  The right-most plot then shows that a mischaracterization of the instrument's beam can mimic the aforementioned uncertainties.  At small angular scales (large $\ell$ values), slight variations of $n_{s}$ change the slope of the power spectrum (Figure~\ref{fig:cmb_ns}).  For this reason, the beam must be well understood and characterized to achieve such ambitious science goals.

\begin{figure}[t!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{Figures/beam_neff.pdf}
    \caption{The simulated CMB power spectrum at varying spectral index of inflation $n_\text{s}$, and varying relativistic species $N_{\text{eff}}$.  Simulations are made with CAMB~\cite{camb_online} and show the $TT$ spectrum's deviation from nominal values, with $n_s\pm\sigma_{n_s}$, and $N_{\text{eff}}\pm\sigma_{N_{\text{eff}}}$.  In red is the sensitivity achieved by Planck, and in blue is the sensitivity goal of Simons Observatory.  The right-most panel simulates a mischaracterized instrument beam and how it can mimic deviations in the $TT$ spectrum of the CMB.}
    \label{fig:cmb_ns}
\end{figure}

Entire classes of inflationary models can be ruled out by constraining $n_{s}$.  Achieving this goal, however, requires precise beam calibration on these small angular scales.  Further, characterizing the polarization leakage from the telescope's beam is critical to map the tiniest signals of the CMB's polarization.  For this reason, this work focuses on beam calibration, both for the Simons Observatory and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope.

Since the detection by Penzias and Wilson in 1965, the cosmology community has made leaps to constrain the black-body of the CMB.  The Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) was the first to measure the CMB power spectrum from space.  Since COBE, the measurement of fluctuations in the CMB has increased in precision, with experiments like WMAP, Planck, for example.  The South Pole Telescope and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, two ground-based telescopes, have pushed the measurement further with increased resolution mapping of the sky.

In the coming years, cosmologists aim to detect the tiniest signals of the polarized CMB.  An ongoing challenge in cosmology instrumentation has been characterizing the polarization spectra of the CMB.  Specifically, the B-mode polarization of the CMB offers a unique window into early-universe physics~\cite{weinberg_cosmo}.  Because scalar perturbations generate E-mode polarization, a measurement of the B-mode polarization directly quantifies the scalar-to-tensor ratio, $r$.  The BB-power spectra has been reported by the Polarbear, South Pole Telescope and ACTPol collaborations~\cite{planck_data,choi_2020,PARAde_2014}.

\section{Outline of Thesis}

First, I overview two ground-based cosmology experiments in Chapter~\ref{ch:instruments}: the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the Simons Observatory (SO).  This work focuses on the development and characterization of optical components for the SO.  In the final chapter of this work, I characterize the optical performance of ACT.

In Chapter~\ref{ch:mma}, I present an overview of the meta-material absorbers used in the SO Large Aperture Telescope optics tubes to control stray light.  I also present the characterization of their optical properties using a radio holography receiver.  These tiles are comprised of an outer metamaterial layer, which approximates a lossy gradient index anti-reflection coating. They are fabricated via injection molding commercially-available carbon-loaded polyurethane (25\% by mass). The injection molding technology enables mass production at low cost.  Room temperature optical measurements verify their control of reflectance to less than 1\% up to 65$^{\circ}$ angles of incidence, and control of wide angle scattering below 0.01\%.

The characterization of optical components is continued in Chapter~\ref{ch:si}, where I characterize the reflectivity and loss tangent measured in the W-band (80-125\,GHz) and D-band (125-180\,GHz) in two samples of float zone silicon with intrinsic stoichiometry - one irradiated by neutrons, which increases the resistivity by introducing crystalline defects, and the other unperturbed.  I find the loss tangent $\tan\delta$ of $2.8\times10^{-4}$ and $1.5\times10^{-5}$ for neutron-irradiated silicon and intrinsic silicon, respectively, both with an index of refraction of 3.41.  The results demonstrate the applicability of silicon as a warm optical component in millimeter-wave receivers.  The depth of the reflection nulls provides a sensitive measurement of dielectric losses.

In Chapter~\ref{ch:ot_holo}, I present near-field radio holography measurements of the SO LATR optics.  These measurements demonstrate that radio holography of complex millimeter-wave optical systems comprising cryogenic lenses, filters, and feed horns can provide detailed characterization of wave propagation before deployment.  I used the measured amplitude and phase, at 4\,K, of the receiver near-field beam pattern to predict two key performance parameters: 1) the amount of scattered light that will spill past the telescope to 300\,K and 2) the beam pattern expected from the receiver when fielded on the telescope.  These cryogenic measurements informed the removal of a filter, which led to improved optical efficiency and reduced side-lobes at the exit of the receiver.  This is the first time such parameters have been confirmed in the lab prior to deployment of a new receiver.

Chapter~\ref{ch:sat_holo} presents additional near-field radio holography measurements, this time on the Small Aperture Telescope (SAT) optics tube.  Using the identical holography setup as described in Chapter~\ref{ch:ot_holo}, I present preliminary characterization of the SAT's optical performance; more specifically, I predict two key performance parameters: 1) the beam profile in the near-field and 2) the far-field beam pattern of the telescope expected from the receiver.

Chapter~\ref{ch:holosim} presents Holosim-ML: a Python code for beam simulation and analysis of radio holography data from complex optical systems.  This code uses machine learning to efficiently determine the position of hundreds of mirror adjusters on multiple mirrors with few micrometer accuracy.  I apply this approach to the example of the SO 6\,m telescope.  The ML framework makes the analysis of these measurements from many receiver positions straightforward to analyze.  I present an example of the SO dual reflector optical system and demonstrated that this approach can yield $<5\,\mu m$ alignment errors, the requirement for SO science goals.

In Chapter~\ref{ch:actbeams}, I analyze maps from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data Release 6.  From the maps, I select point sources and stack them in order to determine the temperature and temperature-to-polarization beams of the instrument.  This method is compared to the planet-derived beams of ACT.  We find the temperature-to-polarization leakage beams are consistent between the two methods, indicating that the planet-derived beams are sufficient for subsequent cosmology analysis.  We also find a spatial dependence of the point sources in the window functions, which we investigate and present several explanations for what might be causing this effect.

Lastly, in Chapter~\ref{ch:conclusion}, I summarize the results from this work and discuss their implications for the future of precision cosmology.
