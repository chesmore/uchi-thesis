In 1965 at Bell Labs, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson serendipitously detected "noise" with their microwave antenna.  This noise was isotropic (same in all directions) and homogenous (same in all locations), and was ultimately the measurement of the cosmic microwave background; radiation from the early universe.
\begin{equation}
    I(\nu,T) = \frac{2h\nu^2}{c^2}\frac{1}{e^{\frac{h\nu}{k_B T}} -1}
    \label{eq:blackbody}
\end{equation}
The temperature power spectrum of the CMB was measured to be a near-perfect black-body (Eq.~\ref{eq:blackbody}), with a mean temperature of~\cite{burke_graham-smith_wilkinson_2019}:
\begin{equation}
    T_{\text{CMB}} = 2.725\,K
\end{equation}
The power spectrum lies in the infra-red range of the electromagnetic spectrum, and peaks at a wavelength $\lambda = 1.5\,\text{mm}$ (Figure~\ref{fig:cobe_power_spectra}). 

This near-perfect black-body is understood to originate during the early universe by the rapid collision of photons with free electrons, to keep radiation in thermal equilibrium with hot dense matter.  As the universe expanded and cooled, however, this spectrum has kept its same form~\cite{weinberg_cosmo}.  Because it formed during the early universe, the CMB is a backlight into not only early universe properties, but also late universe physics such as large-scale structure and dark matter.  The CMB, therefore, carries a wealth of information about the fundamental physics of our universe.

\section{The Expanding Universe}
The evolution of the universe can be described with an extension of Einstein's equations.  To measure distances in an expanding universe, we employ the metric $ds$, which depends on the curvature of the surface:
\begin{equation}
    ds^2 = -c^2dt^2 + a(t)^2[dr^2 + S_\kappa (r^2)d\Omega^2]
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
    d\Omega^2\equiv d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta d\phi^2
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
    S_\kappa(r) = \begin{cases} R\sin(r/R) & (\kappa = +1) \\
  r & (\kappa = 0) \\
   R\sinh(r/R) & (\kappa = -1)\end{cases}
\end{equation}
Here we consider the scale of the universe as a function of time $a(t)$, which relates to the redshift $z$ as:
\begin{equation}
    a(t) = \frac{1}{a+z}
\end{equation}
where we set today's $a=1$.  If $a(t)$ is increasing, then the object is "red-shifted", or a decrease in frequency.  This relationship can be expanded for nearby sources:
\begin{equation}
    a(t)\approx a(t_0)[1+(t-t_0)H_0+ \ldots ]
\end{equation}
where we've introduced the Hubble Constant $H_0$.  The Hubble Constant quantifies the expansion of our universe:
\begin{equation}
    H_0\equiv \bigg(\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\bigg )_{t=t_0}
\end{equation}

\section{The Three Equations of the Universe}

The dynamics of the universe are neatly described by three equations, which connect its curvature to the energy density $\epsilon$ and pressure $P$.

\noindent
\textbf{Friedmann Equation}:  Stemming from Einstein's relativistic field equations, the Friedmann equation describes a homogenous and isotropic universe:  
\begin{equation}
    \bigg ( \frac{\Dot{a}}{a} \bigg ) = \frac{8\pi G}{3c^2}\epsilon(t) - \frac{\kappa c^2}{R_0}\frac{1}{a(t)}
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon$ is the energy density, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $c$ is the speed of light, $\kappa$ is the curvature parameter, and $R_0$ is the radius of curvature at present time $t=0$.  The energy density is evolving, and made up of matter ($\epsilon_m=\epsilon_{m0}a^{-3}$), radiation ($\epsilon_r=\epsilon_{r0}a^{-4}$), and a cosmological constant ($\epsilon_{\Lambda}=\epsilon_{\Lambda 0}$), thus the Friedman equation takes the form:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{H^2}{H_0^2} = \frac{\Omega_{r0}}{a^4} + \frac{\Omega_{m0}}{a^3} + \Omega_{\Lambda 0} + \frac{1-\Omega_0}{a^2}
\end{equation}
where we normalize the energy density $\epsilon$ by the critical density $\epsilon_c(t)$, where $\epsilon_c(t) = \frac{3c^2}{8\pi G}$~\cite{ryden_2016}.  This results in the new variable:
\begin{equation}
    \Omega(t) = \frac{\epsilon(t)}{\epsilon_c(t)}
\end{equation}
The $\Lambda$CDM model assumes a flat $\Omega(t)=1$ universe, comprised of baryonic $\Omega_b h^2$ and cold dark matter $\Omega_c h^2$ densities.
\noindent
\textbf{Fluid Equation}:  Energy conservation can also be applied to describe the dynamics of the universe via the first law of thermodynamics (Eq.~\ref{eq:thermo1}).  This implies the sum of gravitational potential and kinetic energy of expansion is conserved~\cite{ryden_2016}.
\begin{equation}
    dQ = dE + PdV
    \label{eq:thermo1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \dot{\epsilon} + \frac{3\dot{a}}{a}(\epsilon + P) = 0
    \label{eq:fluid_universe}
\end{equation}
\noindent
Solving the fluid equation (with $P=w\epsilon$) yields the equation of state:
\begin{equation}
    \epsilon \propto a^{-3-3w}
\end{equation}
with the time-independent $w$~\cite{weinberg_cosmo}.  For example, in the case of cold matter dominated universe (e.g. dust, $P = 0$) $\epsilon\propto a^{-3}$, and in a hot matter universe (e.g. radiation, $P=\epsilon/3$) $\epsilon\propto a^{-4}$.
\noindent
\textbf{Acceleration Equation}: Combining the first two equations, which constrain an energy conserved universe, yields the acceleration equation describing how our universe expands over time.  
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\ddot{a}}{a} = - \frac{4\pi G}{3 c^2} (\epsilon + 3 P)
\end{equation}
\section{The CMB Temperature Power Spectra}
The cosmic microwave background carries rich science in its temperature and polarization spectra.  The CMB power spectra can be decomposed into spherical harmonics, which result in power spectra as a function of multipole moment $\ell$, where $\ell\approx180/\theta$.  The temperature fluctuations of the CMB are decomposed into spherical harmonics:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\delta T}{T}(\theta,\phi) = \sum_{\ell=2}^{\infty} \sum_{m=-\ell}^{\ell} a_{\ell m} Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\phi)
    \label{eq:cmb_temp}
\end{equation}
where $\ell$ and $m$ are multipoles of the spherical harmonic $Y_{\ell m}$, $a_{\ell m}$ are expansion coefficients, and $\theta$ and $\phi$ represent the angular position on the sky.  The coefficients $a_{\ell m}$ are independent variables, and relate to the CMB's angular power spectra via:
\begin{equation}
    C_\ell^{TT} = \frac{1}{2\ell +1} \sum_{m=-\ell}^{m=\ell} |a_{\ell m}|^2
\end{equation}
This is the temperature power spectrum of the CMB.  Figure~\ref{fig:measured_cmb_spec} shows the measured CMB temperature power spectrum from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, the South Pole Telescope, and WMAP~\cite{Das_2014}.
\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = .75\textwidth]{Figures/temp_power_spectrum.pdf}
    \caption{The CMB temperature power spectra measured by WMAP (yellow), the South Pole Telescope (blue) and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (purple)~\cite{Das_2014}.  The temperature anisotropies of the CMB will be measured with the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4, two upcoming cosmology experiments, with further precision.}
    \label{fig:measured_cmb_spec}
\end{figure}
The shape of the CMB power spectra unlocks properties of the early universe.  For example, the first peak in the power spectrum at around $\ell\approx220$ corresponds to the angle at which we observe the sound horizon, or the distance that sound can travel between the big bang and recombination.  The measurement of this power spectrum's morphology can also determine physical matter ang baryon densities.  The dark energy properties of our universe can additionally be constrained by the power spectrum peak, as the dark energy and matter densities jointly alter the distance to last scattering.  The smaller angular scale distortions are in part due to an inhomogeneous universe at the time of last scattering ($z\approx 1100$). 

\section{The Polarized CMB}
The cosmic microwave background is predicted to be polarized, due to Compton scattering by free electrons during the era of recombination~\cite{}.  Measuring this polarization would indicate the beginning of reionization and further have the potential to uncover effects of primordial gravitational waves.  The electric field of a photon travelling in the $\hat{z}$-direction is described by:
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = .45\textwidth]{Figures/EB_pol.pdf}
    \caption{The polarization modes of the CMB.  The E modes have no curl, while the B modes have no divergence.  The polarization pattern in the CMB is caused by...}
    \label{fig:e_b_pol}
\end{figure}
\begin{equation}
    \Vec{E} = (E_x\hat{x} + E_y\hat{y})e^{i k_z - \omega t }
\end{equation}
We measure the polarization signal of the CMB with Stokes parameters, which we obtain from the electric field $\Vec{E}$, with intensity $I$, linear polarization $Q$, diagonal polarization $U$, and circular polarization $V$ (Eq.~\ref{eq:stokes}).
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    I & = |E_x|^2 + |E_y|^2 \\
    Q & = |E_x|^2 - |E_y|^2 \\
    U & = E_x E_y^* + E_x^*E_y\\
    V & = i(E_x E_y^* - E_x^*E_y) \\
\end{split}
\label{eq:stokes}
\end{equation}
Just as the temperature power spectrum is decomposed into spherical harmonics, we express the polarization of the CMB in terms of spin-2 (where $a^*_{-2,\ell m} = a_{2,\ell m}$) spherical harmonics:
\begin{equation}
(Q \pm iU) = \sum_{\ell m}^{\pm 2} a^{\pm 2}_{\ell ,m} Y_{\pm2,\ell m}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    a_{\ell m }^E & = -\frac{1}{2}(a_{\ell m}^2 + a_{\ell m}^{-2}) \\
    a_{\ell m }^B & = \frac{i}{2}(a_{\ell m}^2 - a_{\ell m}^{-2})
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The E- and B-modes of the CMB are defined as:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    E(\theta,\phi) & = \sum_{\ell m} a_{\ell m }^E Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\phi) \\
    B(\theta,\phi) & = \sum_{\ell m} a_{\ell m }^B Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\phi)
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\section{Status of the Field}
Since the detection by Penzias and Wilson in 1965, the cosmology community has made leaps to constrain the black-body of the CMB.

\end{table}

The Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) was the first to measure the CMB power spectrum from space.  Since COBE, the measurement of the black-body of the CMB has increased in precision, with experiments like WMAP, Planck, for example.  The South Pole Telescope and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, two ground-based telescopes, have pushed the measurement further with increased resolution mapping of the sky.

Now going for polarization signal...

\section{Outline of Thesis}

First, I overview two ground-based cosmology experiments in Chapter~\ref{ch:instruments}: the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the Simons Observatory (SO).  This work focuses on the development and characterization of optical components for the Simons Observatory.  In the final chapter of this work, I characterize the optical performance of ACT.

In Chapter~\ref{ch:mma}, I present an overview of the meta-material absorbers used in the Simons Observatory Large Aperture Telescope optics tubes to control stray light.  I also present the characterization of their optical properties using a radio holography receiver.  These tiles are comprised of an outer metamaterial layer, which approximates a lossy gradient index anti-reflection coating. They are fabricated via injection molding commercially-available carbon-loaded polyurethane (25\% by mass). The injection molding technology enables mass production at low cost.  Room temperature optical measurements verify their control of reflectance to less than 1\% up to 65$^{\circ}$ angles of incidence, and control of wide angle scattering below 0.01\%.

The characterization of optical components is continued in Chapter~\ref{ch:si}, where I characterize the reflectivity and loss tangent measured in the W-band (80-125\,GHz) and D-band (125-180\,GHz) in two samples of float zone silicon with intrinsic stoichiometry - one irradiated by neutrons, which increases the resistivity by introducing crystalline defects, and the other unperturbed.  I find the loss tangent $\tan\delta$ of $2.8\times10^{-4}$ and $1.5\times10^{-5}$ for neutron-irradiated silicon and intrinsic silicon, respectively, both with an index of refraction of 3.41.  The results demonstrate the applicability of silicon as a warm optical component in millimeter-wave receivers.  The depth of the reflection nulls provides a sensitive measurement of dielectric losses.

In Chapter~\ref{ch:ot_holo}, I present near-field radio holography measurements of the SO LATR optics.  These measurements demonstrate that radio holography of complex millimeter-wave optical systems comprising cryogenic lenses, filters, and feed horns can provide detailed characterization of wave propagation before deployment.  I used the measured amplitude and phase, at 4\,K, of the receiver near-field beam pattern to predict two key performance parameters: 1) the amount of scattered light that will spill past the telescope to 300\,K and 2) the beam pattern expected from the receiver when fielded on the telescope.  These cryogenic measurements informed the removal of a filter, which led to improved optical efficiency and reduced side-lobes at the exit of the receiver.  This is the first time such parameters have been confirmed in the lab prior to deployment of a new receiver.

Chapter~\ref{ch:holosim} presents Holosim-ML: a Python code for beam simulation and analysis of radio holography data from complex optical systems.  This code uses machine learning to efficiently determine the position of hundreds of mirror adjusters on multiple mirrors with few micrometer accuracy.  I apply this approach to the example of the Simons Observatory 6\,m telescope.
